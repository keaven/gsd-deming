# (PART) Others tests {-}

# Overview {#overview-other-tests}

We consider other alternative tests for group sequential design.

- Weighted logrank tests such as the @FHRhoGamma and @MagirrBurman tests.
- Combination tests such as the MaxCombo test by @NPHWG2020sim, @NPHWG2021Design.

We will illustrate the concepts based on an experimental R packages.

- [gsdmvn](https://merck.github.io/gsdmvn/): analytically based group sequential design.

In this part, we will cover

- Review of fixed design based on weighted logrank test and MaxCombo test
- Group sequential design with weighted logrank test
- Group sequential design with MaxCombo test
