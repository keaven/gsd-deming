```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(gsDesign)
library(gsdmvn)
library(mvtnorm)
```

In this chapter, we calculate boundary based on the error spending approach following @gordon1983discrete.

We continue use the same example scenario in the last chapter.

```{r}
enrollRates <- tibble::tibble(Stratum = "All", duration = 12, rate = 500 / 12)

failRates <- tibble::tibble(
  Stratum = "All",
  duration = c(4, 100),
  failRate = log(2) / 15, # Median survival is 15 months
  hr = c(1, .6),
  dropoutRate = 0.001
)
```

```{r}
# Randomization Ratio is 1:1
ratio <- 1

# Type 1 error (one-sided)
alpha <- 0.025

# Power (1 - beta)
beta <- 0.2
power <- 1 - beta

# Interim analysis time
analysisTimes <- c(12, 24, 36)
```

- Example 1 in the previous chapter

```{r}
fh_test <- rbind(
  data.frame(
    rho = 0, gamma = 0, tau = -1,
    test = 1,
    Analysis = 1:3,
    analysisTimes = c(12, 24, 36)
  ),
  data.frame(
    rho = c(0, 0.5), gamma = 0.5, tau = -1,
    test = 2:3,
    Analysis = 3, analysisTimes = 36
  )
)
fh_test
```

## Sample size calculation based on spending function

- Implementation in `gsdmvn`

```{r}
gs_design_combo(enrollRates,
  failRates,
  fh_test,
  alpha = 0.025,
  beta = 0.2,
  ratio = 1,
  binding = FALSE, # test.type = 4 non-binding futility bound
  upper = gs_spending_combo,
  upar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = 0.025), # alpha spending
  lower = gs_spending_combo,
  lpar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = 0.2), # beta spending
) %>%
  mutate(`Probability_Null (%)` = Probability_Null * 100) %>%
  select(-Probability_Null) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)
```

- Simulation results based on 10,000 replications.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("simulation/simu_gsd_combo.Rdata")
sim_res_combo %>%
  subset(scenario == "s03") %>%
  select(-scenario, -Analysis, -z, -lower_bound, -upper_bound) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)
```

- Compared with $FH(0, 0)$ using boundary based on `test.type = 4`

```{r}
x <- gsdmvn::gs_design_wlr(
  enrollRates = enrollRates, failRates = failRates,
  ratio = ratio, alpha = alpha, beta = beta,
  weight = function(x, arm0, arm1) {
    gsdmvn::wlr_weight_fh(x, arm0, arm1, rho = 0, gamma = 0)
  },
  upper = gs_spending_bound,
  lower = gs_spending_bound,
  upar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = alpha),
  lpar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = beta),
  analysisTimes = analysisTimes
)$bounds %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)
x
```

- Compared with $FH(0.5, 0.5)$ using boundary based on `test.type = 4`

```{r}
x <- gsdmvn::gs_design_wlr(
  enrollRates = enrollRates, failRates = failRates,
  ratio = ratio, alpha = alpha, beta = beta,
  weight = function(x, arm0, arm1) {
    gsdmvn::wlr_weight_fh(x, arm0, arm1, rho = 0.5, gamma = 0.5)
  },
  upper = gs_spending_bound,
  lower = gs_spending_bound,
  upar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = alpha),
  lpar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = beta),
  analysisTimes = analysisTimes
)$bounds %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)
x
```

- Compared with $FH(0, 0.5)$ using boundary based on `test.type = 4`

```{r}
x <- gsdmvn::gs_design_wlr(
  enrollRates = enrollRates, failRates = failRates,
  ratio = ratio, alpha = alpha, beta = beta,
  weight = function(x, arm0, arm1) {
    gsdmvn::wlr_weight_fh(x, arm0, arm1, rho = 0, gamma = 0.5)
  },
  upper = gs_spending_bound,
  lower = gs_spending_bound,
  upar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = alpha),
  lpar = list(sf = gsDesign::sfLDOF, total_spend = beta),
  analysisTimes = analysisTimes
)$bounds %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)
x
```

## Information fraction

Under same design assumption, information fraction is different from different weight parameters in WLR.

There are two potential strategies to calculate the information fraction:

- Option 1: Use minimal information fraction of all candidate test (implemented in `gsdmvn`).
- Option 2: Use weighted average of information fraction.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/g_info.png")
```

```{r}
utility <- gsdmvn:::gs_utility_combo(enrollRates, failRates, fh_test = fh_test, ratio = 1)
utility$info_all %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 3)
```

```{r}
info_frac <- tapply(utility$info_all$info0, utility$info_all$test, function(x) x / max(x))
info_frac
```

```{r}
min_info_frac <- apply(do.call(rbind, info_frac), 2, min)
min_info_frac
```

## Spending function

- `gsDesign` bound can not be directly used for MaxCombo test:
  - Multiple test statistics are considered in interim analysis or final analysis.

- Design example:

  - $\alpha = 0.025$
  - $\beta = 0.2$
  - $K=3$ total analysis.
  - `test.type=4`: A two-sided, asymmetric, beta-spending with non-binding lower bound.

- Lan-DeMets spending function to approximate an O'Brien-Fleming bound @gordon1983discrete. (`gsDesign::sfLDOF`)
- $t$ is information fraction in the formula below.

$$f(t; \alpha)=2-2\Phi\left(\Phi^{-1}\left(\frac{1-\alpha/2}{t^{\rho/2}}\right)\right)$$

- Other spending functions are discussed in the gsDesign technical manual
  and implemented in `gsDesign::sf*()` functions.

- Upper bound:
  - Non-binding lower bound: lower bound are all `-Inf`.

```{r}
alpha_spend <- gsDesign::sfLDOF(alpha = 0.025, t = min_info_frac)$spend
alpha_spend
```

- Lower bound:

```{r}
beta_spend <- gsDesign::sfLDOF(alpha = 0.2, t = min_info_frac)$spend
beta_spend
```

## Technical details

This section describes the details of calculating the sample size
and events required for WLR under group sequential design.
It can be skipped for the first read of this training material.

## Upper bound in group sequential design

### One test in each interim analysis

- First interim analysis

$$\alpha_1 = \text{Pr}(Z_1 > b_1 \mid H_0)$$

```{r}
qnorm(1 - alpha_spend[1])
```

- General formula (non-binding futility bound)

$$\alpha_k = \text{Pr}(\cap_{i=1}^{i=k-1} Z_i < b_i, Z_k > b_k \mid H_0)$$

### MaxCombo upper bound

- First interim analysis upper bound

$$\alpha_1 = \text{Pr}(G_1 > b_1 \mid H_0) = 1 - \text{Pr}(\cap_i Z_{i1} < b_1 \mid H_0)$$

- General formula (non-binding futility bound)

$$\alpha_k = \text{Pr}(\cap_{i=1}^{i=k-1} G_i < b_i, G_k > b_k \mid H_0)$$
$$ = \text{Pr}(\cap_{i=1}^{i=k-1} G_i < b_i \mid H_0) - \text{Pr}(\cap_{i=1}^{i=k} G_i < b_i \mid H_0)$$

- `gsdmvn` implementation for MaxCombo test

```{r}
gsdmvn:::gs_bound(alpha_spend, beta_spend,
  analysis = utility$info$Analysis, # Analysis indicator
  theta = rep(0, nrow(fh_test)), # Under the null hypothesis
  corr = utility$corr # Correlation
)$upper
```

- Compared with upper bound calculated from `gsDesign`

```{r}
x <- gsDesign::gsSurv(
  k = 3, test.type = 4, alpha = 0.025,
  beta = 0.2, astar = 0, timing = c(1),
  sfu = sfLDOF, sfupar = c(0), sfl = sfLDOF,
  sflpar = c(0), lambdaC = c(0.1),
  hr = 0.6, hr0 = 1, eta = 0.01,
  gamma = c(10),
  R = c(12), S = NULL,
  T = 36, minfup = 24, ratio = 1
)
```

```{r}
x$upper$bound
```

## Lower bound in group sequential design

### One test in each interim analysis

- First interim analysis

$$\beta_1 = \text{Pr}(Z_1 < a_1 \mid H_1)$$

```{r}
n <- 400
qnorm(beta_spend[1], mean = utility$theta[1] * sqrt(n))
```

```{r}
n <- 500
qnorm(beta_spend[1], mean = utility$theta[1] * sqrt(n))
```

- General formula
$$\beta_k = \text{Pr}(\cap_{i=1}^{i=k-1}  a_i < Z_i < b_i, Z_k < a_k \mid H_1)$$

### MaxCombo lower bound

- First interim analysis upper bound

$$\beta_1 = \text{Pr}(G_1 < a_1 \mid H_1) = \text{Pr}(\cap_i Z_{i1} < a_1 \mid H_0)$$

- General formula (non-binding futility bound)

$$\beta_k = \text{Pr}(\cap_{i=1}^{i=k-1} a_i <G_i < b_i, G_k < a_k \mid H_0)$$

- `gsdmvn` implementation for MaxCombo test

```{r}
n <- 400
utility <- gsdmvn:::gs_utility_combo(enrollRates, failRates, fh_test = fh_test, ratio = 1)
bound <- gsdmvn:::gs_bound(alpha_spend, beta_spend,
  analysis = utility$info$Analysis, # Analysis indicator
  theta = utility$theta * sqrt(n), # Under the alternative hypothesis
  corr = utility$corr # Correlation
)

bound$lower
```

- Compared with lower bound calculated from `gsDesign`

```{r}
x$lower$bound
```

## Sample size calculation

- sample size and boundaries are set simultaneously using an iterative algorithm.

### Initiate the calculation from lower bound derived at $N = 400$

```{r}
bound
```

```{r}
gs_design_combo(enrollRates,
  failRates,
  fh_test,
  alpha = 0.025,
  beta = 0.2,
  ratio = 1,
  binding = FALSE,
  upar = bound$upper,
  lpar = bound$lower,
) %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)
```

### Update bound based on newly calculated sample size

```{r}
n <- 355
utility <- gsdmvn:::gs_utility_combo(enrollRates, failRates, fh_test = fh_test, ratio = 1)
bound <- gsdmvn:::gs_bound(alpha_spend, beta_spend,
  analysis = utility$info$Analysis, # Analysis indicator
  theta = utility$theta * sqrt(n), # Under the alternative hypothesis
  corr = utility$corr # Correlation
)

bound
```

- Repeat proceduce above until the sample size and lower bound converge
